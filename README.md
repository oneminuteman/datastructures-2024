Problem Descriptions:
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:

Given a sorted array, this function removes duplicate elements in-place.
The array is modified such that each element appears only once.
It returns the new length of the modified array.
Rotate Array:

This function rotates an array to the right by a specified number of steps.
The rotation is performed in-place, without allocating extra space.
The number of steps to rotate is a non-negative integer.
Contains Duplicate:

Given an array of integers, this function checks if the array contains any duplicate elements.
It returns true if any value appears at least twice, otherwise false.
It utilizes a hash set to efficiently determine duplicates.
Single Number:

This function finds the single element in an array where every other element appears twice.
It utilizes bitwise XOR operation to efficiently find the single element.
Usage:
Each solution is implemented in C++ and provided as a standalone function.
The solutions can be easily integrated into larger C++ projects or used for educational purposes.
Ensure to include the necessary header files and use the provided function signatures for integration.
The solutions are designed to be efficient with optimal time and space complexity.
